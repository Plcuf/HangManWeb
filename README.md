Welcome to HangMan Web. 


To launch the site, you need to run main.go.
Then, get on your localhost at port 6969 through your navigator.
("http://localhost:6969/")

You can change the language and the difficulty in the "Parameters" page.
There are only two languages (for now): French and English.
Difficulty is based on the number of letters of the words so some "easy" words may seem harder than some "medium" ones.


Well that's all.
Have fun!
